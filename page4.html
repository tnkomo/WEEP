                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>T: So what kept you going all these years? From the moment you started. </em><br><br>R: Well we have good staff, and at our height we had 25,000 movies, and that’s three times what Netflix has. You can come and get what you want, when Netflix, a lot of the time, they’ll have a movie for two years and then they’re done streaming it, they go in rotation. Just like they [streaming services] all do that. <br><br><em>T: How has your presence developed within the community since you first opened in 2002? </em><br><br>R: Well we’re the last store now in the Waterloo region. <br><br><em>T: Do you remember how many there were when you started? </em><br><br>R: When we started, I think there were a good couple of dozen, and slowly as the years went on they started to drop off. Part of the reason why we did well too, was because we bought the building. Our rent went down while everyone else’s rent went up. <br><br><em>T: What have you most appreciated about the community since first being here?&nbsp;</em><br><br>R: We get a lot of support, they're sad to see us going. I'm still not sure if we're still going to continue online, we do have an online presence, the online is doing pretty good, a few split ends on that though. But we’ll continue to be online, and this year we’re looking for office space and warehouse space. And we will do it online and by appointment only. <br><br><em>T: Location must change things a lot too, this isn’t the most packed spot. </em><br><br>R: Yeah, there’s no building available on Main Street, and if you’re paying rent there it's not cheap. A smaller shovel but it's our shovel, so to speak. So while all those other guys are gone, we’re still here, so it worked. <br><br><em>T: What would you tell yourself back in 2002 when you first opened your shop?</em><br><br>R: Would have paid myself more! First couple of years I didn’t take any money out, I said I’d make some money later. And I only paid myself minimum wage so. And I probably wouldn't have bought as much stuff, that became really expensive.<br><br><br><em>T: How did the idea come too, to open the shop? Were you just collecting them and thought, “wow I have a lot!”</em><br><br>R: I was putting my tapes in a street market in 1993, and my house was full of VHS tapes, the only rooms I didn’t have VHS tapes in were the bathroom and bedroom, maybe the kitchen. Everywhere else was stacked right up to the ceiling with boxes of tape. I started looking for a building, it took me about three years to find, and that was that. <br><br><em>T: I really appreciate you having me here and just talking.</em><br><br>R: They [streaming services] are being really smart but they're being selfish. They are making their own product, they're a franchise, but they're not releasing it. They’re forcing you to go to Disney, or Prime. You have to come to their streaming service in order to find it and watch it. <br><br></strong><br></p>
