                            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h1>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5"><br>The entertainment industry as an entity is nearly impossible to define, let alone dissect, precisely without extensive context, as its roots intercept numerous theories of thought and social practices over seemingly endless cultures. With this preface, I ask the reader to maintain an open mind throughout the following article, as its intention is to prescribe a jolt of motivation for the reader to think or continue thinking more consciously about their consumerism. With this I pose the following question:<br><br>How do we feel about change?<br><br>To be frank, this is posed as a rhetorical question. The significance of the question really stems from the place of which it was posed to me. <br><br>‘Far Out Flicks’ sits on the edge of Queen &amp; King Street East in downtown Kitchener. I believe it is hard to miss as its exterior colours sit boldly against the city street. <br><br>Upon my first visit several months ago, I caught myself overwhelmed by the sheer amount of product this shop was able to fit within its walls. It had been a considerable amount of time since I had last entered a novelty shop; at least to the degree of which Far Out Flicks is set up. As I began to rummage through the seemingly endless rows of movie DVDs and VCR copies, I felt a wave of nostalgia searching through the shelves as it brought me back to the Blockbuster days, or if you’re from southern Ontario you may remember Rogers Home Video. It was here where I asked myself the question posed at the beginning of this article: <br>How Do We Feel About Change ? <br><br><br>Revisiting a space with eclectic decor such as Far Out Flicks, presents an eerie reminder of what's to come. Or more accurately, experiences we may lose. As one walks through an elaborate museum exhibit, or a well preserved archeological dig site, one may feel an abrupt sense of awe as one recognizes the extensive focused growth in technology and innovation that has been prescribed to our society over time. This is what I felt assessing the various modes of physical copies of films Far Out Flicks had available to sell. DVD players, VCR sets, these are items many of us fail to use day to day due to the convenience of technology. I digress. As a child, picking a film at the video store was a vital and essential segment in what I considered a fulfilling week. In what appears to be a natural turn of events, visiting these types of shops is now done romantically, as one entertains their sense of novelty. <br><br>Following my first visit to this particular video store, I was curious to understand how owners of businesses in danger navigate the market in troubling times. Industries continue to evolve and technology continues to improve, shaping the activities we participate in and love. As we continue to progress our understandings and ideals of the cinema, and other evolving mediums alike, questions of morality and monetary reward will forever be discussed.<br><br>Please Consider the following discussion (interview) in broadening your understanding of what exactly is taking place behind the scenes regarding distribution, and what exactly is happening that's shifting the industry in its entirety.<br><br><br><br><br>Written by Thembekani Nkomo August 2021.</p>
